# Team work contract group Autozen

## Student project teamwork contract for DSCI 591 Capstone

**Team members:**

Tony, Zoght

Dhruvi, Nishar

HanChen, Wang

Mengjun, Chen

**Team Contract**

**Meetings:**

-   With Capstone partner: every **Monday 2-3PM**

-   Student-only group: Thursday or otherwise decided (in-person if needed on Friday before the seminars)

-   Meet with Gittu: set up with him

**Communication**

All communication outside of the meetings will be through Slack or Github. Github will serve as the primary communication tool for sharing ideas, submitting work, and reviewing work. Slack will be used for informal communication and scheduling meetings. To ensure timely communication, the team will identify a platform that everyone checks regularly to avoid missing any notifications.

**Roles:**

| Week | Moderator | Notekeeper |
|:----:|:---------:|:----------:|
|  1   |   Tony    |  HanChen   |
|  2   |           |            |
|  3   |           |            |
|  4   |           |            |

|  6   |           |            |

**Role of Moderator:**

-   Takes the lead in meetings to represent your team.

-   The day before the meeting, she/he should send an agenda to the broader team (via email - you can get all email address from the email chain). These should be the items that need to be discussed in the next day's meeting.

-   Create an issue in the GitHub repo with the agenda.

**Role of Notetaker:** (This is considered to be rough, so you don't need to look at how well you write it or format it)

-   Taking minutes of what is happening and what is said. Just capture the critical points said.

-   These minutes need to be added to the issue created by Moderator as a comment.

**Collaborative work:**

-   Github issues and Project Board

**Expectations**

Each group member is expected to work on the project and complete their assigned tasks before the weekly team meeting. All submissions should meet the criteria for the milestones outlined in the instructions, which includes ensuring that all scripts are functional, creating tests for all functions, and using proper grammar in written submissions.

**Attendance**

Each group member should give their best effort to attend all meetings. If there is any meeting that they know will miss, notify the team as soon as possible and ideally 24 hours in advance.

**Reviews**\
When pull requests are created, members are expected to add all teammates as reviewers. All pull requests should be reviewed by at least 1 member, and official approval only needs to be given by one (the proof-reader). Pull requests should be reviewed within 24 hours after creation.

**Deadlines**

Deadlines for individual items will be assigned during meetings. The moderator will review the work before Monday's meeting and ensure that the final version is ready for display and create the required version tag.

**Internal deadline:**

The team has agreed to complete majority of the assigned tasks before Thursday's meeting. If an individual is struggling with meeting the expectation, they are expected to notify the group 24 hours before the schedule time.

**Breach of Contract**

Failure to follow the team contract will result in a three-step warning system:

1.  The first step is a written Slack notice that outlines the violation of the team contract and a reminder of the team contract conditions.
2.  The second step is a meeting to discuss the behavior and write an agreement to follow the team contract is required by the member.
3.  The third step is to reach out to the mentor or TAs of the issues with the teammate
